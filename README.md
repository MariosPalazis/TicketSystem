This is a complex Solidity smart contract consisting of two contracts, `TCKToken` and `TicketingSystem`. 

`TCKToken` is an ERC20 token with additional functionality for minting new tokens (`mintToUser`) and transferring tokens between accounts (`transferCustom`). The token is initially created with an initial supply by its creator (`msg.sender`). 

`TicketingSystem` is a ticketing system for events. It allows event creation, event removal, ticket purchase, ticket transfer between events, balance checking, reward distribution and withdrawal of contract funds. 

`TicketingSystem` has various functionalities including:
1. `createEvent`: Create a new event with given name, available tickets count, price per ticket, and set it as active. The event ID is also generated by incrementing an internal counter `eventIdCounter`.
2. `removeEvent`: Deactivate an event by setting its `active` status to `false`. Only owner can call this function. 
3. `purchaseTickets`: Allow a user to purchase tickets for an event. It checks if event is active, if enough tickets are available for purchase, if user has enough tokens in their account for purchasing these tickets. It also calculates cost based on number of tickets bought and price per ticket. If `msg.value` is greater than or equal to `cost`, it decreases `msg.value` by `cost` and transfers tokens from user's account to contract's account (if tokens were paid). It then updates tickets owned by user in selected event and decreases total tickets available by number of bought tickets. 
4. `getUsersTickets`: Return an array of tickets owned by user for each active event. 
5. `getEventList`: Return an array of all events with their properties (`eventId`, `name`, `ticketsAvailable`, `price`, `active`). 
6. `getTotalSupply`: Return total supply of tokens in `TCKToken` contract. Only owner can call this function. 
7. `getTotalSupplyUser`: Return balance of tokens of user's account in `TCKToken` contract. 
8. `getContractBalance`: Return current balance of contract's account in Wei. Only owner can call this function. 
9. `withdrawToOwner`: Allow owner to withdraw funds from contract's account into owner's account in Wei. Only owner can call this function. 
10. `getRemainSupply`: Return remaining supply of tokens in `TCKToken` contract (i.e., balance of contract's account). Only owner can call this function. 
11. `changeRewardLimit`: Allow owner to change reward limit. Only owner can call this function. 
12. `setEventStatus`: Allow owner to set status of an event (`active` or `inactive`). Only owner can call this function. 

The contract includes a fallback function for receiving Ether (`receive()`) and a fallback function (`fallback()`) for receiving funds (both Ether and ERC20 tokens). 

Please note, this contract does not handle token transfers on ERC20 tokens directly in `transferCustom` function in `TCKToken` contract because it is a security risk if there is a possibility of re-entrancy attacks. It's better to use ERC20's `_transfer` function for token transfers in such cases. 

Also note that this contract includes an internal constant `rewardLimit` for distributing rewards to users for buying tickets above a certain limit (`msg.value`). The rewards are in Wei. 

This contract uses OpenZeppelin's ERC20 contract for basic token functionalities like `_mint`, `_burn` etc. 

Overall, this contract seems to serve as a platform for ticket sales with additional features for token management and reward distribution. 

It is important to note that this contract is a complex one and might require a thorough understanding of Solidity, ERC20 token standard, Ethereum's security model and contract security best practices to properly understand its functionality.
